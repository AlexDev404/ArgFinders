These are currently all the methods that i know of
1. Getting args from replacing be
2. Getting args from logs 
3. Getting args from memory 
To do the first method check ArgGetterBE.cpp 
To do the second method check ArgGetterLOGS.cs
To do the third method, go into hxd (or another memory viewer) select BE 
while having fortnite open. And find fltoken (CTRL + F) and you should find it.
